# Overview

Using the data from over 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years, we are going to use machine learning to predict whether future applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

# Results
•	Data Preprocessing
o	The Target variable of our models is the ‘Is_Successful’ column.
o	The Features variables of our models are the ‘Application_Type’, ‘Affiliation’, ‘Classification’, ‘Use_Case’, ‘Organization’, ‘Status’, ‘Income_Amt’, ‘Special_Considerations’, and ‘Ask_Amt’ columns.
o	The ‘EIN’ and ‘Name’ columns have been removed from the data and are not being used.
•	Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
o	Up to 3 hidden layers were used.
o	No, the target model performance of 75% was not achieved. 
o	In an attempt to increase model performance, different Epochs were used, as were 2 and 3 hidden layers.
